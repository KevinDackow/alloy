/*
This files contains two parts:
	1) All valid state transitions.
	2) Test to ensure the state transitions are independent of one another
	3) Tests from all other files.

	Valid state transitions are represented by sigs.

	An important note:
		All valid state transition sigs must advance state such that all other state 
		information remains the same . Additionally, state transition functions
		must enforce this behavior themselves for the sub-State components which they modify. 
	  	This file only makes sure the other larger sub-States remains unchanged.
			AN EXAMPLE:
				if you call usermod, it will change the userGroupState. It is the responsibility of the
				usermod pred to ensure that every component of userGroupState remains the same
				which is supposed to, whereas it is the job of this file to ensure that the other sub-State
				components, such as the fileSystemState, remain the same.
		The rationale of this is so that one does not need to modify every StateTransition file when one adds
		a new valid state transition elsewhere, and instead one only needs to edit this file.
